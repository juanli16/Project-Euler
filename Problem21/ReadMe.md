**Amicable** numbers are such that the sum of all the proper divisors of the first
number is equal to the second _**amicable**_ number, and the sum of all the proper 
diviosrs is equal to the first _**amicable**_ number. 

This python script computes all *amicable* numbers under input number n
and then computes their sum. 

The algorithm for finding the divisors is _**O(sqrt(n))**_
